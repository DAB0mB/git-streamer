# Git Streamer

Using a single command line you can start a new video call, and share your screen along with your code. Every change that you make in your project will be reflected live in the hosted text editor, so participants can easily collaborate with you and submit their changes as well. Git Streamer was designed to be extremely easy and efficient, specially built for programmers, for the purpose of being able to share more frequently, and/or working remotely.

To further understand how Git Streamer works I recommend you to read about [Web RTC -â€ŠA protocol for implementing video conferencing](https://eytanmanor.medium.com/an-architectural-overview-for-web-rtc-a-protocol-for-implementing-video-conferencing-e2a914628d0e).

## Getting Started

To get started, install `gits` CLI:

    $ npm install -g @git-streamer/cli

And create a new session:

    $ gits

Once the session has been created, the browser will open, and the session URL will be copied to your clipboard so you can start sharing it with your colleagues. Git Streamer will also lookup for new updates, and if it detected any, it will update itself automatically.

For further help and launch options, type:

    $ gits --help

## Security

Git Streamer requires read/write access to project files. It will be watching over changes in your `.git` and project directories, and it will be streaming these changes to whoever is listening on the other side.

If specified, the participants of the call will have the ability to edit files directly from the hosted text editor; Git Streamer will be listening to these changes and will be merging them to your project. If the changes were forced outside of the scope of your project, they will be ignored.

Git Streamer uses proxy servers as means to stream some changes (turn/stun, signaling server) and will not store any of your data unless explicitly given permission to do so.

## Terms of Service

**Use at your own risk!**. Git Streamer will give read/write access to people who are attending your call. Despite my efforts to make Git Streamer safe to use, you should bare in mind that it's in an early stage of development. I will take no responsibility in case of leak of information, hijack, Trojan, or any kind of malicious injection.
